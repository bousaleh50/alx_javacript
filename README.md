# Alx_javascript_Repo
This repository contains programs written for the Higher-level programming track at the ALX Intro To Software Engineering Program. In these projects, I learnt Javascript, and I also made use of concepts learnt. Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:
